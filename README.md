This bot uses an algorithm based on center of gravity to open and close positions. It also uses a calculator model to determine trade size based on total account value, and has built in percentage based scale out functionality.

Requires cTrader version of Lazy Bear COG.

Bot is intended as a proof of concept only, the current trading logic used is not consistently profitable in backtesting. I accept no responsibility for its use.
